Original IWWE&M concept, design and coding done by
José María Fernández González, INB (C) 2008-2009.
Source code of IWWE&M is available at http://trac.bioinfo.cnio.es/trac/iwwem

Introduction
============

If you are reading this, you either have a snapshot or a working copy of IWWE&M
source code, or you have got it from Internet.

As IWWE&M source code is publicly available from a Subversion repository, you can
check it out using any Subversion client, like the Eclipse Subclipse plugin,
TortoiseSVN, command line svn, etc... So these checkout instructions are focused
on command-line.

The way to get a fresh copy of IWWE&M sources from IWWE&M SVN repository is:

svn co http://trac.bioinfo.cnio.es/svn/iwwem/trunk INBWorkflowLauncher

so you have the fresh copy in INBWorkflowLauncher directory. When you have
fulfilled all the IWWE&M installation pre-requisites then you can proceed on
IWWE&M compilation and installation.

Pre-requisites
==============

These instructions distinguishes between the compilation machine and
the installation machine, which could not be the same. Both of them
have more or less the same software pre-requisites.

* Compilation machine

	- You need a working Java JDK 1.5.x or 1.6.x. IWWE&M backends have been tested with both
	  IBM JDK and Sun JDK. It should also work with Apple JDK, but I would not trust on gij
	  (GNU interpreter for Java).
	- You also need to install both Ant and Maven (aka mvn) build systems.
	- You need a working Perl installation, with the next modules. Depending
	  on the Perl version you have installed, some of them can be already
	  integrated in the Perl core:
	  	+ TimeDate (for Date::Parse)
		+ Encode
		+ CGI
		+ LWP (aka libwww-perl)
		+ Mail::Sender
		+ URI
		+ MIME::Base64
		+ XML::LibXML (which depends on libxml2)
		+ XML::SAX
		+ File::Copy
		+ File::Path
		+ File::Temp
		+ IO (for IO::Handle)
		+ Time::HiRes
		+ POSIX
	- A working SSH client, so IWWE&M can be put in the installation machine.

* Installation machine

	- You need a working Java JRE 1.5.x or 1.6.x. IWWE&M backends have been tested with both
	  IBM JDK and Sun JDK. It should also work with Apple JDK, but I would not trust on gij
	  (GNU interpreter for Java).
	- A recent Graphviz package (2.16.x or better) for its 'dot' command. It is used by the
	  Taverna core.
	- You need a working Perl installation, with the next modules. Depending
	  on the Perl version you have installed, some of them can be already
	  integrated in the Perl core:
	  	+ TimeDate (for Date::Parse)
		+ Encode
		+ CGI
		+ LWP (aka libwww-perl)
		+ Mail::Sender
		+ URI
		+ MIME::Base64
		+ XML::LibXML (which depends on libxml2)
		+ XML::SAX
		+ File::Copy
		+ File::Path
		+ File::Temp
		+ IO (for IO::Handle)
		+ Time::HiRes
		+ POSIX
	- A working Apache web server. It should work with other web servers, but
	  it has not been tested.
		+ A separate user should be created for IWWE&M, and then Apache should
		  be set up to handle mod_userdir. In that way, CGI processes from
		  IWWE&M will be run with that separate user.
		+ cgi-bin directories must be set for CGIs in subdirectories. For instance,
		  next pattern works for per-user cgi-bin.
		
			<Directory /home/*/public_html/*/cgi-bin>
				Options ExecCGI
				SetHandler cgi-script
			</Directory>

	- A working SSH server, so IWWE&M can be installed from the compilation
	  machine.
	- Bash shell.
	- Enough storage for the workflow repository (which includes the enactions
	  and snapshots).

Setup steps
===========

0.- In the compilation machine, obtain a copy of the IWWE&M sources.
    For instance, from a svn checkout (explained above).

1.- Change to the directory where the sources are living, and edit build.properties, where
    you can set up the installation machine properties:
	cd INBWorkflowLauncher
	vi build.properties

    The keys are:
	* deploy.host is the installation machine. If the compilation and installation machine
	  are the same, the localhost value is right.
	* deploy.ssh.user is the user used for scp and ssh, which is going to own the IWWE&M
	  installed files.
	* deploy.ssh.dir is the directory where IWWE&M is going to live.
	* deploy.ssh.keyfile is the keyfile used to authenticate on scp and ssh transfers.
	  By default it is the one from the user.
	* deploy.ssh.passphrase is the passphrase used to decrypt the keyfile, if it is needed.

2.- Copy file weblauncher/cgi-bin/IWWEM/MailConfig.pm.example to
    weblauncher/cgi-bin/IWWEM/MailConfig.pm , and then edit it. It contains the variables used
    to setup IWWE&M mail parameters, like the SMTP server (variable $SMTPSERVER). If SMTP server
    needs authentication, then $SMTP_ENCODED_CREDS, $SMTPUSER, $SMTPPASS variables are taken
    into account. The first one is used to tell whether user and password are base64 encoded,
    the second one is the user to send e-mail and the third one is the password to send e-mail.

	Optional steps
	- - - - - - - -

3.- You can edit weblauncher/etc/IWWEM-config.js, where some variables used by IWWE&M AJAX GUIs
    can be tweaked, like Version string and default logo.

4.- File weblauncher/cgi-bin/IWWEM/Config.pm contains some IWWE&M frontends constants which can
    be tweaked, like the number of max concurrent workflow enactions (variable $MAXJOBS) or
    web URL path mappings (hash %HARDHOST).

Install steps
=============

0.- If any of these steps fail, please open a new ticket on IWWE&M Trac:
    http://trac.bioinfo.cnio.es/trac/iwwem/newticket
1.- In the compilation machine, change to the directory where the sources are living and
    compile everything:
	cd INBWorkflowLauncher
	ant compile

2.- Now it is time to install the system on the installation machine:
	ant deploy
