INBWorkflowLauncher 0.1.0
=========================

Introduction
------------

This program is a wrapper around Taverna libraries, so
Taverna workflows which don't need interactions can be
run from command line.

This program is based on Taverna's 1.6.2.0 example program
workflowlauncher, whose sources can be fetched from Taverna
Project Sourceforge Site. This program is very interesting
because it removes most of the Taverna's Raven overhead,
so load time is better than Taverna's one. The drawback of
this approach is that the application cannot self update
the core components from Taverna that it uses.

Prerequisites & Configuration
-----------------------------

As Taverna, this is a Java application which needs a compliant
Java JRE 1.5 (or better) Virtual Machine. The application was
tested and compiled with Sun JDK 1.6, so if you have any
problem please contact me (jmfernandez@cnio.es).

Once the application bundle is uncompressed, you can see several
sub-directories. The more interestings are:

*	bin: This one contains scripts to run the application
	from Unix and Windows.
*	conf: The configuration files for Taverna and log4j cores
	live here.
*	repo: All the Java libraries needed by the application
	are located here. As Taverna, this application has been
	compiled using Maven, so this directory is basically a
	maven local repository.

By default, the application will generate a log file called
inbworkflowlauncher.log at user's home directory. This behaviour
can be changed setting up log4j.properties file which lives in
"conf" subdirectory.

Also by default, the application is going to create a directory
called .inb-maven at user's home directory. This directory contains
all the runtime libraries needed by Taverna which are not from its
core, like SOAP, WSDL or BioMOBY plugins. This is also a maven
repository. The location of the directory can be changed on
invocation using -basedir param, which is explained below.

Known bugs
----------

The invocation scripts were generated by Maven's appassembler plugin. This plugin
generates scripts which change the current working directory to the application's
base dir. So, if you feed the application with relative paths, the will be
wrongly understood.
